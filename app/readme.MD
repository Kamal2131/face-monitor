Face-Monitor App Overview and Architecture
 The face-monitor project is a FastAPI-based webcam proctoring tool. Its 
app directory likely contains a
 Python FastAPI backend and a simple frontend (HTML/JS) for video capture. The backend probably exposes
 a WebSocket endpoint to receive frames and runs a face-detection model (e.g. OpenCV or a deep learning
 face-recognition library) to monitor test-takers in real time. This follows the pattern in similar apps: for
 example, a FastAPI app can use WebSockets and OpenCV to “seamlessly detect human faces in real-time
 1
 camera video streams” . In practice, the folder might include an 
app.py or 
main.py (initializing the
 FastAPI instance), route modules, and a machine-learning module with a face detector. The frontend likely
 consists of an 
index.html and a 
script.js that capture the user’s webcam via JavaScript and send
 frames to the server. Indeed, a typical setup uses an HTML page and a JS script that “connect[ ] to a
 WebSocket in the browser. It will handle sending requests and receiving responses to and from our API” .
 Data (e.g. recognized faces or alerts) may be logged or stored for analysis. In summary, the architecture is
 roughly:
 2- Backend (FastAPI/Python): WebSocket and/or REST endpoints, face-detection/recognition logic (e.g.
 using OpenCV, Haar cascades or a DNN)
 1
 . Python FastAPI is a common choice for such APIs .
 3- Frontend (HTML/JS): Web page that captures webcam video (via WebRTC 
getUserMedia ) and streams
 2
 frames or images to the FastAPI server over WebSocket .- Models/Data: A face detection model or library. Possibly user management (e.g. student profiles) if
 implemented. Data storage for logs or alerts. 
Overall, face-monitor looks like a standard asynchronous FastAPI app with real-time video processing. The
 WebSocket connection and front-end JS form the live stream pipeline, and the FastAPI backend runs face
 analysis on each frame to flag issues (e.g. no face, multiple faces, or lack of attention).
